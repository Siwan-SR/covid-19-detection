# 🦠 Covid 19 Detection 

A neural deep learning model that detects whether a person has Covid 19 using chest X - rays.

## 🔍 Data

The data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabeelsajid917/covid-19-x-ray-10000-images

## 🥧 How the model was made

The model was made using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), an excellent machine learning and deep learning library. I used Keras as the model.

## 🏗️ How the notebook is structured

* Explore the data
* Create model
* Log model records
* Train the model
* Load the best model and find its accuracy

## 🔍 What you will find

* The use of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* Many awesome functions
* Use of the [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/) model
* A Tensorboard which visualizes the model records
* Accuracy of the best model
* Practical example of Covid detection using X-rays
